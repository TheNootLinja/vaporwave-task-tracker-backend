# Backend for Vaporwave Task Tracker

This repo contains the codebase for the backend of the Vaporwave Task Tracker application.

My goal for building this is to be able to add the ability for tasks that have been added to be persistent instead of being lost when the application is closed and in the future possibly also give me the ability to add user accounts.

The backend of this application is built using:
-mongodb
-express
